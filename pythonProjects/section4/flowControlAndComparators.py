Flow Control and Comparators:
1.create a variable and assign to it an expression that is true using the greater than comparator
2.create a variable and assign to it an expression that is false using the greater than comparator
3.create a variable and assign to it an expression that is true using the greater than or equal to comparator
4.create a variable and assign to it an expression that is false using the greater than or equal to comparator
5.create a variable and assign to it an expression that is true using the less than comparator
6.create a variable and assign to it an expression that is false using the less than comparator
7.create a variable and assign to it an expression that is true using the less than or equal to comparator
8.create a variable and assign to it an expression that is false using the less than or equal to comparator
9.create a variable and assign to it an expression that is true using the equal to comparator
10.create a variable and assign to it an expression that is false using the equal to comparator
11.create a variable and assign to it an expression that is true using the not equal to comparator
12.create a variable and assign to it an expression that is false using the not equal to comparator
